<p>Dear Vassar Parents and Families, </p>
<p>As co-chairs of Parent Giving, we welcome parents to the Vassar community for the 2016-2017 academic year. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve experienced first hand the intellectual and personal growth that transforms students who attend this extraordinary college.  And we all, as parents, play an integral role in supporting these young people throughout their Vassar experience.  here are a few ways that you can impact campus life for all Vassar students. <br>
    </p>
<ol>
      <li>Get involved with our <a href="http://careers.vassar.edu/info/parents-and-families/">Career Development Office </a>(CDO).  Please consider partnering with the CDO, an invaluable resource in helping Vassar students make the challenging transition from college to career.  Whether mentoring a student, sharing your professional experience, offering an internship, or hiring a Vassar grad, you can have a profound impact on the future of a Vassar student.  </li>
      <li><a href="http://alums.vassar.edu/giving/?s=button">Make a Gift!</a>  The Vassar Fund supports every aspect of a Vassar education.  Unrestricted gifts in particular allow the College flexibility in applying resources to the areas greatest need, or greatest opportunity, over the course of each year.  Contributions to the Vassar Fund help meet current expenses for academic program support, library acquisitions, technology, athletics, career counseling and numerous other student-related programs. </li>
</ol>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>Again, welcome to the Vassar Community!  We look forward to meeting you at a Vassar event in the coming months. </p>
<p>Best wishes for the year ahead. </p>
<p>Kary and John McIlwain P’18 <br>
